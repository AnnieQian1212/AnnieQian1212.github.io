# The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

## Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

### Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting one percent better everyday counts for a lot in the long-run.

### Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.

### Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

### An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Juat as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of the remarkable results.

### If you want better result, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

### You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your system.

### There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.

### The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.

### Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

### Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

### The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
